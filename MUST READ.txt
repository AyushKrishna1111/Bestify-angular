dependencies installed :-
-----------------------------


1. FONT-AWESOME :

INSTALL STEPS LINK :-
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/angular-fontawesome

SEE USAGE SECTION (given in same page) FOR IMPORTING THE REQUIRED MODULES

2. BOOTSTRAP

RUN THIS COMMAND :-

ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
 
npm install popper.js --save // if this is not installed components may not work such as nav bar will not expanding on clicking its button 
npm install jquery --save // this is required because bootstrap is intelnally written with jquery

after this add the following lines in angular.json otherwise bootstarp components will not work properly

"styles": [
"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
],
"scripts": [
"./node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",
"./node_modules/popper.js/dist/umd/popper.min.js",
"./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"
]

3. ngcharts.js and ng2-charts

dont install from main site as it is not compatible with my code :
https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-charts

instead found actual soln here :
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66936633/chart-js-ng2-charts-not-working-on-angular2

SOLUTION TAKEN FROM STACKOVERFLOW :-
RUN THESE 2 COMMANDS :
npm install chart.js@2.9.3 --save
npm install ng2-charts@2.2.3 --save

THEN run npm i and restart the project.

------------------------------------------------------

modules to import in your project (otherwise code will break ):

HttpClientModule
FormsModule
FontAwesomeModule
ChartsModule

// for rest see app.module.ts

----------------------------------------------------------

TODO :

Use the bootstrap components from ng angular library installed (like accordion used in about-the-site component) instead of using regular html (
like header , bootsrap tabs used in admin game,admin quiz componnet etc)
 
CHECK : https://bootsnipp.com/ for good login,search bar, footer and other UI components that can be used in project.

------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT STUFF :

1. Footer not fixed issue resolved from following link :

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18990675/how-to-fix-a-footer-overlapping-content

Go for this answer :-
" I believe you were looking for a sticky footer that stays while not being fixed to the bottom of the page (so no overlap). "


2. Sending data from service to component

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34376854/delegation-eventemitter-or-observable-in-angular/35568924#35568924


3. Writing media query using bootstrap size versioning 

First in your scss file add this line in top :-

@import 'node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss';

then add your media queries. See header.scss file for example
